Requirements:

1) You will need to have access to SUDO if doing a system install (not required for personal install)
2) You will also need CULR or WGET installed. = For the original Firefox download 
3) Depending on your distro, you will also need TAR or UNTAR, or BZIP2 installed. = To decompress .tar.bz2 file

All of which are usually pre-installed and configured in all major mainstream Linux distros.

Run the following command:

   chmod +x Setup.sh 

   (Or for 32-bit:  chmod +x Setup32.sh)

This will make the script executable (allowing it to run).  
Next, execute the script by type the following:

   bash Setup.sh
  
   (Or for 32-bith: bash Setup32.sh)

You can also used your prefered shell, for example, dash, zsh, ksh (POSIX compatible).

Please follow the easy menu prompts and complete the setup.
You can install or uninstall any edition you wish, including multiple editions side by side.


Congratulations, you have successfully setup your copy of Mozilla Firefox!

Linux is best (because it really is).

Want to learn more?

All the script files can be opened with a basic text editor.
There you can review the code and learn how they work.
For basic text editors, I recommend either "nano" via the terminal 
or via your desktop, "kate" or "leafpad" or "xed" or "gedit".

As always, happy browsing! :-)
