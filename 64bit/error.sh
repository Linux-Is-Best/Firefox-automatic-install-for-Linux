#
# Welcome to my easter egg (v1). Allow me to tell you a little about myself.
# Hi, I am the developer of "Firefox Automatic Install for Linux" and "Thunderbird Automatic Install for Linux."
#
# Linux is best, because it really is. And that is why I chose my user name. lol
#
# My browser of choice is Mozilla Firefox (Gecko), and the re-release of Netscape (WebKit) currently being developed (no ETA, it's not my development).
# My distro of choice is SUSE Linux (both openSUSE and SUSE Enterprise Desktop).
# My desktop of choice is XFCE and KDE.
#
# If I had to choose a fallback, it would be either Debian or Arch Linux and perhaps Vivaldi Browser and Cinnamon desktop.
#
# Fun fact: I was the annoying little kid (because I was a kid at 10yrs old) who could not type worth anything and did not know what I was talking about
# when trying to tell Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, how his OS would be a failure. I have never been so wrong. Oops! My bad. Live and learn, right?
#
# What I like about Linux is it is yours. No one can tell you how to use Linux or manage it or what programs you must or must not have.
# There is no product activation or expiration date, and if you choose to pay to support a Linux development, no one can later take your installation away from you.
# Linux has no required monthly or yearly subscription fees for you to install, use, or update the Linux operating system. Linux is yours, and it is free to use forever.
# I like that most things found in Linux are open source or shared source, and nearly anyone can contribute to its development.
#
# What I dislike about Linux is the gatekeeping in the Linux community. And that is a lot to unpack and so many ways I could explore that statement. But I imagine enough people know what I mean.
#
# I wish everyone good health, long life, good fortune, and genuine peace, love, and happiness. I sound like a hippy, but I am not. Still, my wish for you all is sincere.
#
# Thanks for reading and for using or sharing, or contributing to my script. And as always, happy browsing! (enjoy your time on The Internet)
