New to Linux? Not a problem. - Welcome to Linux!

Basic requirement:

# You will need to have access to SUDO. = For installation
# You will also need WGET installed. = For the original Firefox download
# You will also need TAR or UNTAR installed. = To decompress .tar.bz2 file

All of which are usually pre-installed and configured in all major mainstream Linux distros.

Decide if you wish to install 64-bit or 32-bit of Firefox (stable), Firefox beta, Firefox Developer Editions, 
Firefox Nightly, or Firefox ESR (Extended Support Release). You also have the option to install 
ALL editions of Mozilla Firefox (details below).

Run the following command followed by the edition of your choice. 

chmod +x script-name-here.sh

This will make the script executable (allowing it to run).  
Next, execute the script of your choice by typing one of the following.

./script-name-here.sh
 
-- OR --
 
sh script-name-here.sh

-- OR --

bash script-name-here.sh

You will be prompt to enter your password (for SUDO) to continue with the install.

You can install any edition you wish, including multiple editions side by side by 
running their script accordingly. You also have the option to install ALL editions 
by using firefox-option.sh

Congratulations you have successfully installed your edition of Firefox.

Linux is best (because it really is).


Want to learn more?

All the script files can be opened with a basic text editor.
There you can review the code and learn how they work.

For basic text editors, I recommend either "nano" via the terminal or "gedit" via your desktop.

As always, happy browsing! :-)
