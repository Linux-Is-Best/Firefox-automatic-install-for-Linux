# Firefox-automatic-install-for-Linux
Automated installation for Mozilla Firefox for The Linux Operating System.  The objective is to provide a method to easily install Mozilla Firefox directly from their website and enable Firefox's automatic update feature for the latest releases.  The additional goal is to provide that installation supports a multi-user environment.

With these series of scripts, you can automatically install the latest version of Firefox in a multi-user environment within the Linux Operating System.  As with any bash scripts it must be made executable for them to properly execute ( chmod +x ). Each edition of Firefox has it's own edition script allowing the user to selectively decide which edition they prefer. Furthermore, each script installs the edition of your choice within its own (independent) directory allowing you, if you choose, to install multiple editions safely side by side on the same computer system.

Lastly, there is the bonus option to automatically install all additions by executing firefox-option if you so desire.
