# Firefox-automatic-install-for-Linux
Automated installation for Mozilla Firefox for The Linux Operating System. The objective is to provide a method to easily install Mozilla Firefox directly from Mozilla's website and enable Firefox's automatic update feature for the latest releases. 

To properly install or uninstall Mozilla Firefox, go to your extracted folder and run the following command:

chmod +x Setup.sh

This will make the script executable (allowing it to run).  Next, execute the script by typing one of the following.

   ./Setup.sh

-- OR --

   bash Setup.sh

You will be prompt to select which edition of Firefox you wish to set up. You will also be prompt to enter your password (SUDO) to continue. You can install or uninstall any edition you wish, including multiple editions side by side. Simply follow the easy menu prompts.
