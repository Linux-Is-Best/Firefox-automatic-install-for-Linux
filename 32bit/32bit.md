Hello 32-bit Linux user.

Using an older computer?
Still on an older 32-bit OS (operating system)?
Have a love of 32-bit applications?

No problem.  This folder contains all the scripts needed for 32-bit editions of Firefox.  Follow the same instructions found how-to-install.txt

For normal end-user usage, you need only pick between 32-bit or 64-bit (not both).

-- Happy Browsing!
