With these series of scripts, you can automatically UNINSTALL the previously installed version of Firefox. As with any bash scripts it must be made executable for them to properly execute ( chmod +x ). Each edition of Firefox has it's own edition script allowing the user to selectively decide which edition they prefer to remove. Additionally, within each script is the advance option to remove the home configuration files if necessary. Optionally, you also have the option to run firefox-all-UNINSTALL.sh which will remove ALL 32-bit Firefox editions in a single script (please use with care).
