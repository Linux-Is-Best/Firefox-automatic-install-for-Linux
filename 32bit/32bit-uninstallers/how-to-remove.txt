Run the following command to choose which edition of Firefox 32-bit
you would like to uninstall from your computer.

chmod +x Uninstall32.sh

This will make the script executable (allowing it to run).  
Next, execute the script by typing one of the following.

   ./Uninstall32.sh

-- OR --

   bash Uninstall32.sh

You will be prompt to enter your password (for SUDO) to continue with the uninstall.
Or if you previously installed ALL editions and wish to remove ALL editions 
simply use 32firefox-all-UNINSTALL.sh


Thank you for using Mozilla Firefox.
Really sorry to see you go.
Hope to see you again real soon.
