Attention developers and Mozilla Firefox enthusiasts:

YES, you can technically install the 32-bit editions alongside the 64-bit editions as they use different paths.  
They should also register as different classes in your logs or via system resource management such as top or htop.

FirefoxNightly = 64-bit
FirefoxNightly32 = 32-bit

You will, however, need to EDIT the script manually to rename the shortcuts.  

This development is primarily to make things easier for newbies and having a 
shortcut called, "Firefox Nightly 32" (for example) just seemed tacky for the end-user experience.  
But if your goal as a developer is multi-platform and bit support; you are likely used to the idea of redundancies.
