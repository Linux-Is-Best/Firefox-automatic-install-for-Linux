To uninstall your personal copy of Mozilla Firefox.


chmod +x  YOUR_choice.sh (for example, unNightly.sh which uninstalls Firefox Nightly)
bash YOUR_choice.sh

(Or your personal shell of choice followed by, YOUR_choice.sh)


Or you can edit and use Uninstall.sh (If not edited, it will automatically uninstall Firefox stable release).
There is also, uninstall_all.sh which assume you've installed all editions and removes them all.
